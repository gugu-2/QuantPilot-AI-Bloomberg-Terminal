## About

**QuantPilot** is a pure native C++20 desktop application designed for the AI era of finance. It uses **Qt6** for a blazing-fast UI and embedded **Python** for executing sophisticated, long-running LangGraph agent architectures. Rather than just displaying data, QuantPilot actively analyzes, reasons, and executes via its autonomous agent hierarchy and Gemini LLM backend.

---

## What's New: The AI Era

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 🧠 **Gemini Copilot Engine** | A floating natural language interface that converts plain English (e.g., "Run sentiment on AAPL") into strict JSON, instantly automating complex UI and research tasks via the global EventBus. |
| 🤖 **LangGraph Trading Agents** | Deploy multi-agent teams (Fundamental, Sentiment, Technical Analysts) that actively debate market conditions in the background before proposing trades. |
| 🧩 **Community Marketplace** | Hot-swappable AI plugins. Instantly download third-party Python algorithms, parsers, and custom LangChain agents directly into your workspace. |
| 🛡️ **Human-In-The-Loop Execution** | Deep C++ memory protections and sandbox timeouts keep AI scripts contained. Agents can only *propose* trades to the UI; no live money executes without a human click. |
| 🌐 **100+ Data Connectors** | DBnomics, Polygon, Kraken, Yahoo Finance, FRED, IMF, World Bank, AkShare, plus alternative-data overlays like Reddit/StockTwits sentiment tracking. |
